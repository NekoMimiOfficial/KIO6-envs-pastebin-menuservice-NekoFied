# KIO6 envs pastebin integration  
This simple servicemenu allows you to upload any image of choice to the envs.sh file null ptr just by right clicking  
It's a one simple script that does it, there's unlikely any updates to this script  
  
!> [!IMPORTANT]
> Somehow envs.sh went down immediately after i pushed the last commit so im switching it to 0x0.st, it's weird  
  
# Installation  
Make sure you have the following dependencies before proceeding:  
- xclip  
- notify-send  
- your ~/.local/bin/ folder added to path  
- a KDE Plasma desktop of version 6  
  
After these requirements are met you can use the install script:

Next you can open dolphin and navigate to its settings (ctrl+shift+,) and click the context menu and make sure the service is enabled
